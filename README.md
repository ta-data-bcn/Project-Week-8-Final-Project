## Project Description
This project aims at analyzing Tesla stock evolution from 2010 onwards (IPO on January 2010).
Tesla stock value has evolved following an unusual trend, slow growth from 2010-2018, and sudden spike from 2018 to 2020.
Tesla stock has known very high volatilty, and has been the one [most-shorted US stock]('https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-most-shorted-companies-us-traders-betting-against-apple-2020-2-1028873641'), meaning that many investors bet against it.

The project has 3 chapters analyzing the evolution of the stock on 3 metrics :
- Elon Musk's past tweets habits and how they may have had a strong impact on Tesla's stock value
- Tesla car production history and future previsions on its stock evolution
- General trends of stocks & competitors from 2010 onwards

## Hypotheses / Questions
* My original project was to measure the impact of past Musk tweets, especially from 2018 onwards, to measure their impact on the actual stock value :
	* Do the stock markets react strongly to Musk tweets ?
	* Do Musk tweet promises to deliver new innovative products impact positively the stocks ?
	* Does Musk influence greatly the stock prices when tweeting - general or Tesla related - information ?
	* Do his Twitter controversies harm badly Tesla's stock evolution ?
	* Did investors reacted strongly to Musk's controversial tweets in 2018-2019 ?

* Second hypothesis : from 2010 to 2018, Tesla has produced a small amount of cars and could not deliver on its ambitious promises.
My hypothesis is that, for many years, investors shorted Tesla, not believing on its delivery capabilities. 
But the progressive success of Model 3 from late 2017 onwards should greatly impact positively the stock evolution and would be the main reason for important spike 
	* did the hard launch of Model 3 in 2017, and its important production rise in 2018 impacted positively the stocks ?

* To measure various potential influences over the stock price evolution, other KPIs were taken into account :
	* Car production history from 2010 onwards
	* general stock market environment evolution

* What is the context for the question and the possible scientific or business application?

* What are the hypotheses you would like to test in order to answer your question?  
Frame your hypothesis with statistical/data languages (i.e. define Null and Alternative Hypothesis). You can use formulas if you want but that is not required.

## Dataset
Each Dataset creation & its scraping are detailed in their respective Notebooks.

I used 3 distinct datasets to measure my various metrics :
- Musk's Twitter database from Twitter scraping - based on [GetOldTweet3 Python script]('https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python')	
	* 8797 tweets gathered - 1 row per tweet - 8 columns :
														date
														text
														retweets
														replies
														favorites
														tweet_interactions
														permalink
														to
														hashtags
														mentions

	* Divided into 4 datasets :
		- general topic unique tweets (8797 tweets) & groupby days
		- Tesla related tweets (1100 tweets) & groupby days

- Tesla car history sales, based on scraping (Pandas function pd.read_html) & download of existing datasets (Kaggle & DataWorld)

- Stocks database for several Tech & Car companies from web data scraping  based on web.DataReader scraping of Yahoo Finance! data
	* dataset for each company - 7 columns from scraping :
								High (highest price of the day)
								Low (lowest price of the day)
								Open (Opening price)
								Close (Closing price)
								Volume (Volume of stock sold a day)
								Adj Close (Adjusted Closing price)
								avg_price (Average price of the day)

	* Car stock values merged into one Car Company dataset
	* Tech stock values merged into one Tech company dataset

## Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did as well as your reasoning behind the process.

### Custom variable created #### 

- Twitter interactions : sum of all interactions over a tweet (retweets, replies, favourites) - asumption that tweet generating an important amount of interactions convey important piece of information (business related, funny original content, controversies etc. )
- Scaled Adjusted Close / Scaled Twitter interactions : to plot both evolution of stocks values & Twitter interactions, both variables have been MinMaxScaled to be comparable

## Workflow
My workflow consisted on working sucessively on my 3 chapters to measure, for each part, the correlation and the potential impact on the stock.
Each Workflow is detailed in its respective Notebooks.

**1 - the stock evolution analysis was the most straighforward** : clear & efficent data scraper to gather all needed data. I  gather the data from a range of Tech & Car making companies, to then compare them to Tesla stock.
Applying same methodology for each financial sets : gathering data, grouping together, measuring the correlation)

**2 - car making history** : collecting & cleaning the data took some time, due to the various range of data structure I gathered. Important phase of datawrangling in order to create a clean dataset of the history of car from 2010 onwards.
I then plot the evolution of car making to Tesla's stock evolution to measure correlation.
Finally I applied Facebook Prophet to create car making prediction for a 2-year period/

**3 - Twitter analysis** was the longest one to do : scraping the data, cleaning it and dividing it into several dataframes, creating several indicators.
I went through several test phases, by plotting several periods and making some research about the potentially interesting tweets to study.

Creation of the Twitter interactions indicators and the Function ploting_delta in order to plot, for each Top influential tweet, the 10 day delta to measure its potential influence over stock evolution.

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

#### Part 1 - Twitter Quantitative & Content Analysis #### 
Musk is an influent Twitter user (over 32M followers), and a very active one (8797 tweets gathered for the studied period). Would he message have strong influence over his company's stock price ?

After analyzing its 8797 tweets as a whole, this study will focus mainly over Tesla related tweets (1100 tweets) and, among those, over the top 200 tweets in terms of interactions (i.e. sum of retweets, replies & favorites).

**Plotting Musk Twitter Habits**
what are his Twitter habits ?
is there any kind of seasonality in his tweet publications ?
do the amount of tweets evolve over time ?

<img src="/DataSets/Twitter_data/Twitter Analytics PNG/twitter_seasonality.png" alt="Twitter seasonality"/>

The amount of tweets grows constantly from 2012 onwards ; peaks of Twitter activity in 2017, mid 2018 & late 2019

Raise of Twitter interactions may be explained by two reasons :

- important raise of daily tweet posts generate more interactions per tweet
- important raise in the number of Twitter followers may generate more organic interactions per tweet (currently Musk has 32M followers, six months ago he had "only" 28M - therefore the more followers, the more interactions each can generate. Unfortunately, no historic data available for the evolution of Twitter followers

##### Focus on positive tweets #####

- 2018-04-01 'April's Fool Day Bankrupcy Joke' case

Following tensions with investors and short-sellers, Musk published two tweets stating that Tesla is going bankrupt.
Even if it has been made in a fun fashion, it is a kind of abysmal message for potential investors ;
yet the stock did not present any specific trend evolution

#### Part 2 - Car Production History 2010-2020 #### 
Tesla production has been mainly divided into two phase:
- production of Luxury model for premium audience : Model S from 2012 onwards & Model S from 2015 onwards
- production of mass market Model 3 car from 2017 onwards

* Until 2016, car production relatively low in terms of amount of unit produced = stock grow slowly based 
* Starting 2018 Q1, Model 3 production started to grow - but did not generated immediate stock spike important spkie in

## Model Training and Evaluation
Stock prediction based on [Facebook Prophet]('https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/saturating_forecasts.html#forecasting-growth') growth prediction model . 
cf. two detailed articles on Medium used during the research phase: 
	- [Using Facebook’s Prophet to Predict Mongolian Stocks]('https://medium.com/mongolian-data-stories/using-facebooks-prophet-to-predict-mongolian-stocks-cdf4feabd558')
	- [Forecasting Stock Prices using Prophet]('https://towardsdatascience.com/forecasting-stock-prices-using-prophet-652b31fb564e')

#### 2 Prediction Models developed ####
To compare Prophet predictions, two Models based on different datasets have been developed :
   * Evolution of Car production VS. Stock price for 2020-2022
   * Evolution of Stock price for 2020-2022 based on previous values

- Stock Price Model Training & Evaluation based on 2010-2018 stock value to compare them with actual results from 2019-2020
	* overall growth trend well predicted, even if Tesla last year very important spike in stock value has not been predicted. May be considered an anomaly and is rather hard to predict

### Model 1 Stock Prediction based on previous value ###


#### Prophet Stock Prediction 2018-2020 #### 
![Prophet Stock Prediction 2018-2020](https://github.com/Binardino/Project-Week-8-Final-Project/blob/master/DataSets/Stock_prediction_PNG/Prophet_stock_prediction_2018-2020.png "Prophet Stock Prediction 2018-2020")


#### Prophet Stock Prediction 2020-2022 #### 
![Prophet Stock Prediction 2020-2022](https://github.com/Binardino/Project-Week-8-Final-Project/blob/master/DataSets/Stock_prediction_PNG/Prophet_stock_prediction_2020_2022.png "Prophet Stock Prediction 2020-2022")

- Tesla incredible stock evolution from mid-2019 onwards is quite hard to predict. Overall linear trend from 2010 to 2018 remains the overall long-term trend which has been developed by Prophet 

- Prophet tool generates smoothened trends which may seem rather accurate ; the Machine Learning algorithm, fed by 2010-2020 data has generated long-term trend, miscalculating the stock drop in 2019 and the important spike in the stock price in 2020. 

- the stock growth trend remains positive for the 2 years predicted, even if, obviously, the further away the prediction is being made, the less accurate it gets, due to high rate of uncertainty (impossible to predict long-term market dynamic, coronavirus crisis etc.)


### Model 2 Stock Prediction based on Car production prediction ###
Using Prophet to predict the future Tesla Car productions, based on the current production of Luxury Models & Model 3 and then the future of Stocks productions, based on the current quarterly trend.
Since we are working on a Quarterly based Dataframe, the prediction should be different from the dayly stock price prediction made in the other Notebook

Prophet takes only two variables : 'ds' (for Date - here Quarters from 2010 onwards) and 'y' (for the desired measure)

#### Car Production VS. Stock prediction 2020-2022 ####
