## Project Description
Even though nowadays the hottest topic is the current Covid crisis. I wanted to express through data, that Global Warming is not something we can't leave out to chance.
I enjoyed the Machine Learning module, but for my Final project I choose to do a statistical analysis of the current Climate Change. 
My goal was to see how much could I show using python and tableau about a topic that is always in my mind since I heard about it in school when Iwas a kid.
I gathered numerous Global and Country indicators to show that the Climate Change issue is one that we need to tackle quickly and unanimously.

## Hypotheses / Questions
- The first interest I wanted wasn't a question per se. I wanted to convince as many people as I coyld that we must take global warming seriously, because before solving a problem you have to ackowledge it.
- The second thing I wanted to do was answer if this crisis can be solved somehow.

- And finnaly, if it can be solvet, why are we not taking the needed action unanimously?


## Dataset
- for the datasets I used csv from the indicators I thought I would need. They are mainly from _Kaggle_ and _Our World in Data_.
- It wasn't easy to find the porper data and hadto change directions a few times, but finnaly I found what I needed to tell my story.
- Regarding the good results, I wish that there was even more data on the topic and more accurate data because I'm sure that the governments of certain countries don't give away the full information for obvious reasons.

## Cleaning
- To clean the data I had to use few methods and functions from pandas in order to adapt them all so I could merge them and analyse the results in Tableau.
- The main problem was to know exactly what I wanted to get out of each indicator to processit in the way the fit me the best.

## Analysis
- the analysis is mainly based on correlations and timeseries progresion from certain indicators.
- It's not a very complicated analysis, but I think it's power lays on it's simplicity. 
- In just a few charts I'm able to show that the global warming is a real threat that we need to adress right now, even if it's through this Covid crisis.


## Conclusion
 - If we don't reduce the CO emissions, mitigate deforestation and focus on renewable energies our future could be too hot for us the bear.
 - We already solved together a big crisis with the ozone depletion, how come we can't do the same with the global warming?
 - Descarted the excuse of the economic competitiveness, we can only assume that those making the desicions have interests in the highly contaminating fossil fuel industry.

## Future Work
- I would love to do this analysis again after this Crisis to see in what ways it has affected our planet's enviroment and the prespective in which we look at this issue.
- I'm waiting to see if the USA does indeed withdraw from the Paris agreement this next November, because It could be the worst news for our future.

## Workflow
- I researched many topics, most of them about machine learning, but at the end I decided I felt more like doing a statistical analysis and test my visualization and storytelling skills (I'll be practising my ML skills everyday from now on).
- I Researched for data, found messy datasets, serached again and so on until I found those datasets that I could clean and adapt for the analysis.
- Here I started coding. I cleaned and merged the data sets.
- I plotted some charts using matplotlib and them I moved on to tableau, where I performed my analysis.
- I used my results to build the story I wanted to tell and then I made the presentation.

## Organization
In the repository you will find:
- The main Jupyter Notebook with the name of the project
- A folder with all the images I used for the presentation and the notebook.
- A folder with all the datasets used in the project.
- This Readme file
